# Project Title
The Conway's Game of life is a zero player cellular automation game which means that it's evolution is based on it's initial state. 
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

   Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
   Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
   Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
   Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations. 
## Getting Started

Firstly, fork the repository and clone it. Make sure to run it on netbeans 8.2. Add the project as an existing project in the open tab in the netbeans IDE.
Once you get the code working, you are ready.

### Prerequisites

The following are a few prerequisites required.

```
* Knowldege of object-oriented-programming
* Basic usage of swings.
* Knowledge on Java
```

## Deployment

Just make it as a simple java project and run it as a java application
